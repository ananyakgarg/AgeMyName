# AgeMyName
Magic app that tells you your age if you give it your name. 


## The Beginnings
- Played around with API
- Refreshed myself on EnvironmentObjects, Observable Objects, to implement MVVM architecture
- Understood how Codable types work, and how we can use them to convert JSON objects to Swift types
- Implemented basic frontend UI ('22-23 App Team Themed)
