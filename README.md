# AgeMyName
Magic app that tells you your age if you give it your name. 


## The Beginnings
- Played around with API- (https://agify.io/)
- Refreshed myself on @EnvironmentObjects, @ObservableObjects, @State
- Understood how Codable types work, and how we can use them to convert JSON objects to Swift types
- Implemented basic frontend UI


## The Fun Part
- My end goal was to have it dynamically update as characters are typed. (Goal acheived ðŸŽ‰)
- Making sure the user isn't inputting spaces because that is not how the API works
- Played around with colors, and I found that cyan and pink were complementary colors so I went with that
